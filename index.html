        <p class="lead mb-4">I would say that my greatest skill is my adaptability. I have developed this skill by participating in a wide variety of extracurriculars from athletics to performing arts as well as enrolling in AP classes. Racing against other schools on the track and field was unnerving. Performing on stage in front of hundreds as a violist was discouraging. Executing rifle drills while a brigade watched was daunting. But from all these initially unpleasant experiences, I learned how to improve upon myself by developing characteristics and habits that ultimately made me adaptable. To me, this means being able to perform tasks with proficiency and finesse no matter what they may be. The situation that most profoundly exhibited this trait was during a track meet against three other schools. The bleachers were filled with students of all ages, eagerly cheering their friends and classmates on. As a 100 meter sprinter myself, running the 400 meter race was not ideal for me, but I trained in the little time I had to prepare for it. I ran up and down hills early in the morning before school to condition my body for endurance. Though it was only for a small portion of an hour, every minute I took to get ready for the race made a big difference. After stepping up to the starting line I felt a surge of confidence and my mind cleared of all distractions, trusting that my body will cooperate. I ended up taking second place. Through the many unavoidable stresses that my extracurriculars have put me through, I learned that although you canâ€™t always control the obstacles you face, thereâ€™s always something you can do to prepare yourself to face them. <br><br>

        In my sophomore year of high school, I was elected 10th grade officer by my dragon boat team. I was an officer for the year working with one of the six other officers every week. My responsibilities included calisthenics training, coaching while we were on the water, steering, and managing volunteer and fundraising events. It was my first time assuming a leadership position, but I accomplished the goal to make the team perform better physically and to work together as a team. During calisthenics training, I created and led two-hour workouts. The workouts that I designed were structured to gradually increase muscular strength and endurance by increasing repetitions, time, and performing harder workouts. For water training, I steered the boat around Lake Merced while calling out exercises that help us train for races. We focused on improving whatever we were lacking during water practice, perfecting timing/rhythm, power, and technique. In order to move a dragon boat, a team must paddle together at the same time, with good effort, and certain techniques to allow for proficiency and reaching the optimum time to win. My contributions to the team were evident in the physical examinations we had at the end of the year and the improvement in our time during the five races we have every year. All of my 60 team members scores for the physical testing were well over Californiaâ€™s standards for physical fitness in public schools. This experience allowed me to see through the perspective of a leader and practice the techniques that I learned in different situations and places of work.

        Senior year of highschool I applied to Hollister Co. and worked as a Sales Associate as well as a Stock Associate, trained to work both the front and back ends of the store. This involved both customer service, merchandise maintenance, fulfilling online orders, and managing inventory.
